# Bouncing Ball Game

A simple **Pygame-based arcade game** where the player controls a paddle to keep the ball bouncing and avoid letting it fall off the screen. This project is designed as a fun and interactive way to learn basic game development using Python and the Pygame library.

## Features
- Gradient background with smooth color transitions.
- Background music and sound effects for an immersive experience.
- Paddle control using arrow keys.
- Ball movement with realistic wall and paddle collision effects.
- Score tracking.
- Instructions screen and a restart option after the game is over.

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Use **Left** and **Right Arrow Keys** to move the paddle.
2. Press any key to **launch the ball** at the start.
3. Avoid missing the ball as it bounces; if it falls below the paddle, the game ends.
4. Press **M** to toggle background music and **S** to toggle sound effects.
5. After a game over, press **R** to restart.
